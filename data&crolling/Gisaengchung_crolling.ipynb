Up untl the end, I liked it very, very much....but after the ultra-violent climax, I was left a bit cold.

      "               PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think.\n",

It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up. There are scenes which I can almost smell. This is a very compelling statement about class in society.\n",

We need to shed our cultural biases, including \"how\" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.\n",

So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper.

      "               Okay, so these slightly over two hours are \"Parasite\" or \"Gisaengchung\", the original title that probably nobody in Europe or the United States is really aware of. This is one of the biggest players this awards season, also in North America, and that I find really surprising. It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this year. I guess it helps that director Bong Joon-ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past. So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now. Anyway, people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film, I don't think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations. It is decent, maybe good, nothing more. This is the story of a really poor family, unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence (the son's friend) manages to sneak in at a rich family's house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related.\n",

For example that the driver really gets fired or that when hiring the mother as the new maid that the rich husband and wife do not talk about who made the suggestion. And there are more moments like this. It does feel kinda fictitious at times for me, which is a bit of a negative dealbreaker for sure because like I said you can see that this film tried to make a powerful statement. It also sometimes felt too much as if they were taking the idea of a parasite and what it does as too defining like how it kills the host eventually, which is what one man does to the other near the film's end and that really did not feel realistic at all to me. Just showy and for the sake of it because even in his letter he said that he felt sorry for the man and respected him, so if he should have attacked anybody, then I'd say it should have been the guy who lived down there and went rogue before that on everybody, especially the protagonist's family. And also that the son really with all the blood literally pouring out of his head survived the attack as we find out did not feel too likely to me. It was interesting though that it was this big rock he was attacked with that clearly meant something to him as he saved it when everything was under water before that and they had to leave their real home. Karma maybe a bit because they say this big mansion is their new home.\n",

      "               Still there are funny moments too. After all this film calls itself a satire. The highlight comedically for me was when they are all under the bed and this scene easily could have gone wrong, but it was hilarious, especially when all except the dad get out, but then the rich family's son calls his parents and he is down there on the ground in the middle of the room, but they don't see him. Don't suspect anything. But before that it is not too respectful how they talk about the man's smell. So they are definitely on the shallow side when (they think) their employees are not nearby. The escalation started really from the moment they let the old housekeeper in the house again. I also wondered why they did. I mean I can see why they opened the door, but then they should have asked what she wants and brought it to her, which of course would not have been possible, but this would have been the approach that made sense in this scenario. Okay what else can I say about this film let me think. The three younger women were all really stunning. Somebody who says Asian women are not particularly attractive should see this film and maybe he will change his mind.\n",

      "               I have read people compare this film to Pulp Fiction, but I would not agree with that at all. The ending is as bloody as anything Pulp Fiction has to offer, but this is hardly a criterion I'd say. It felt completely different to me and also slightly inferior at least. Key subjects like religion, absolution, betting, sexual abuse and drugs are not at the center of this film here and brief talk about drugs on one or two occasions does not change that. But kinda ironic that with this comparison the director of this film is going against Tarantino at the Oscars too, even if I am pretty sure BJH is not winning. I am not sure if I like the idea of Tarantino winning the big prize this year and maybe his first Oscar for his direction, but his film is definitely way superior compared to this one here. The other contender is Scorsese and while I think his film is not too bad, I am also not won over by that one as I was by Tarantino's. Scorsese's is roughly on par with Parasite.\n",

      "               <br/>\n",
      "               So to sum it all up, a few more words on Parasite: It has a really nice (almost) sex scene and in general the film was working best for the comedic moments for me. The only thrilling moment in terms of drama that had me on the edge of my seat was when the former maid was walking down this long path and we had no idea what was coming. Maybe people also liked this film so much because you never knew what would happen next and if for example the family was capable of killing the two rich guys (and their kids) in order to experience wealth for years to come. They are ruthless, but are they criminals? Up to you to decide and it is all subjective. Also interesting to see their confidence rise when early on they don't do anything against the guy almost peeing right into their home, but later on they are ready to attack him. So yes, it as an interesting movie that felt shorter than it actually was, but I still must say it was not a great watch and the awards attention is just too much, also for the cast, or basically for the one guy who gets all the acting praise here (the father I think). Still go see this one, just don't go in it with great expectations. I give it a thumbs-up and I am curious to see how it fares at the Golden Globes 2020 that are just about to start five minutes from now.\n",

      "               A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.\n",

      "               The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.\n",

Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative.\n",

      "               This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. \"Parasite\" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.\n",

      "               Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it's way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim's weren't able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim's demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It's not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park's. Not that it wasn't done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.\n",

      "               <br/>\n",
      "               Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim's luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim's had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim's from their lucrative positions.\n",

      "               I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim's (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can't say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of 'crossing the line' that the Kim's were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it's denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo's survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.\n",

      "               As for the ultimate finale, who's to say that Kim-woo's plan to rescue his dad wasn't a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - \"\"If you make a plan, life never works out that way\". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park's, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn't turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year's Best Picture at the Oscars.\n",

      "               Bong Joon-ho's \"Gisaengchung\" (\"Parasite\" in English) became the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And it was a deserved win. Like \"Joker\", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic!\n",

      "               A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw \"The Host\". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it.\n",

      "               I heard about this South Korean a few months before its release, the title itself sounded interesting to me, but I also knew it was predicted to do very well during Awards Season, in fact, it went on make history at the Academy Awards, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer). Basically, the Kim family: father Ki-taek (The Host's Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), live in a small semi-basement apartment, have low-paying temporary jobs, and struggle to get by. Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to bring material wealth to whoever possesses it. Min-hyuk is leaving to study abroad, before leaving he suggests to Ki-woo he should take over his job as an English tutor to the wealthy Park family's daughter, Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Ki-woo poses as a university student and is hired by the Parks; Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) decides to call him Kevin. Subsequently, the Kim family begins to infiltrate the Park family home by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated but sophisticated skilled workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with Da-hye. Ki-jeong poses as \"Jessica\", an art therapist for restless young son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Ki-jeong frames Mr. Park's chauffeur Yoon (Park Geun-rok) for having sex in his car, and suggests her \"uncle\" for the job, so Ki-taek, a former valet, is hired. Finally, the Parks' housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) has a severe allergy to peaches, the Kims exploit this and convince Mrs. Park that she has tuberculosis, and Chung-sook takes over. When the Parks leave to go on a camping trip, the Kim family take advantage, living in the empty luxurious mansion. The former housekeeper unexpectedly returns, claiming left something in the basement. The Kims are shocked as she reveals a hidden entrance to an underground bunker, created by the famous architect and previous owner of the mansion. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon), has been secretly living underneath the home, to hide from loan sharks, for the last four years. After realising the truth about the Kim family, Moon-gwang threatens to tell the Parks their secret if they do not, in turn, keep hers. A brawl breaks out among Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. They are interrupted when Mrs. Park calls, they are returning home early, the trip has been cancelled due to a rainstorm. Geun-sae is dragged back down below, while Moon-gwang is fatally wounded when pushed down the stairs. The two are trapped in the bunker, while the Kim family scramble to clean up their mess. After Chung-sook serves her dinner, Mrs. Park tells about how Da-song had a traumatic experience years ago when he saw a \"ghost\", Geun-sae, emerging from the basement. The remaining Kims hide underneath the sofa in the living room, Mr. Park complains to his wife about a smell, which is Ki-taek. The Kims, after some failed attempts and near misses, eventually manage to escape the Parks' house. Returning to their apartment, they are devastated to find it completely flooded due to the storm and are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other people made homeless. The next day, Mrs. Park decides to host a party for Da-song's birthday. She invites Ki-jeong and Ki-woo, while Ki-taek and Chung-sook are required to be employees. During the party, Ki-woo heads down to the bunker with the scholar's rock intending to kill Geun-sae. After accidentally dropping the rock down the stairs, Geun-sae attacks him, bludgeoning him with the rock and escaping. Seeking revenge for the death of Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jeong with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers a trauma-induced seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out, until Chung-sook kills Geun-sae with a skewer. Ki-taek tries to help Ki-jeong, but Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek takes the kitchen knife and fatally stabs Mr. Park before fleeing the scene. Weeks later, Ki-woo has survived the attack and wakes up from his coma following surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of fraud and put on probation, Ki-jeong is revealed to have died from her injury, and Ki-taek has vanished and is wanted for Mr. Park's murder. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. The Park family home has been sold to German family, but Ki-woo continues to scope it out. He notices the flickering light in the house and recognises it as a message in Morse code. It is a message from Ki-taek, who is now living in the bunker, which he decodes. Still living in the semi-basement apartment, Ki-woo responds to his father, vowing to one day earn enough money to buy the house, free his father, and the family will be reunited. The film's title is a double meaning, it can refer to the poor family manipulating their way into the lives of the rich family, or the rich family themselves in terms of labour, leeching off others to do to the work, it could also refer to the sinister character beneath the house. This film works well as a satirical and intricate examination of class conflict, and as a film of two halves. The sneaky set-up is a savage social commentary with an impoverished family conning their way up, and then it completely shifts gear with a darker tone and surprising moments that will get under the skin. It is the first film from South Korea to gain Oscar nominations, it became the first foreign language film in history to win the top prize at the Academy Awards (beating big contender 1917 from Sam Mendes), and the first to win Best Picture and the foreign language category together. At a time where the lack of diversity is debated, this film will hopefully pave the way for changes, it is a fantastic dark comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han, and Best International Feature Film (formerly Best Foreign Language Film), and it was nominated for Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay.

      "               This Oscar winning Korean film is centred on the Kim family; they live in a distinctly downmarket neighbourhood and struggle to earn enough money. One day a friend of Ki-woo, the son, tells him of a job opportunity; the wealthy Park family need an English tutor for their teenaged daughter. Equipped with forged qualifications he gets the job, not only that he suggests that his sister, Ki-jung, who he introduces as a cousin of a friend would be the ideal art tutor for their son. It isn't long before Father, Ki-taek, and mother, Chung-sook, are also employed as driver and housekeeper... all this is done in a way that doesn't give away that they know each other. Things are looking up for the Kims as they enjoy their new situation; then the old house keeper, who they got fired, returns and their new success is threatened in a surprising way.\n",

      "               This film is hard to pigeonhole; it is a comedy that provides plenty of laughs; it is a social commentary of the vast difference in wealth in Korean society; it toys with horror tropes; there is some romance; and has violent moments. It could have turned out to be a real mess but the elements blend together almost perfectly. The cast does a really fine job making the characters believable even when the situation is far-fetched. For the most part it is set within the Park's large, modern house; the only other location of note it the contrastingly small basement flat the Kim's call home... the comparison emphasises who different the families' circumstances are. The story provides some twists, which I won't spoil here; these often lead to a shift in tone... even when things turn darker in tone there are still laughs to be had. Director Bong Joon-ho, who also co-wrote the story, does a great job as the film treads the fine line between brilliance and silliness... always keeping on just the right side. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something a little different.\n",

The title, which the director argued for, has a dual meaning. Sure, the poor servants are living off of the rich, but the masters are living off the labor class. They've lost the ability to clean and even move around for themselves. Everyone is a parasite in their own way.\n",

Yet it's hard to be for the family in this movie, as their machinations only prove that when they get the status they want - even for one fleeting night as they steal whiskey and a view of a yard that can never be theirs - they still hold down and destroy the lives a level beneath their own, only to then learn that their home has been flooded and taken away.\n",

Mom wasn't so enamored of the story because it didn't have a happy ending and I, well, I admire the way it was written, performed, and filmed but, yeah, I didn't love it.

      "               I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie. The premiss that a family of grifters manage to infiltrate a pretty vacuous wealthy family by pretending to be, initially, a qualified English teacher, then an off-the-wall art teacher; a chauffeur and finally a housekeeper is original, funny and harmless. The humorous and mischievous way the family gel with their ambitions for a better life is a testament to the excellent performances from the four the principal characters. Regrettably, however, the second half descends quite rapidly into a farcical story that drags it down. Their harmless deception takes on a far more sinister - and implausible - guise as we quite literally discover (living) bodies under the stairs. It's now almost slapstick; ultimately violent and Bong Joon Ho now just seems to have lost his way. Yeo-jeong Jo is good, too, as the wealthy wife and I would heartily highly recommend this film, but it is - in my opinion - nowhere near as good as \"Mother\".\n",

      "               That verse by Ogden Nash, itself a satire, may well contain the nucleus of Parasite, a movie in which nothing is sacred and anything goes. I am unable to put my hand on my heart and agree with the Academy that it was the Best Picture of 2019 but I can say that it was far from the worst. Most viewers in the West, of course, were obliged to rely on subtitles to follow the story and while subtitles have never been a problem for me I always feel a slight sense of loss if a given piece of art is not written in my first language; if, for example, I am watching, say, Uncle Vanya, sitting next to a native Russian speaker, and the English translation is the finest possible I still feel that the native speaker is getting ten or twenty per cent more out of the play than I am via untranslatable nuances. So it was with Parasite but what remains is highly enjoyable.\n",

      "I was able to see \"Parasite\" a few days ago at the Philadelphia Film Festival and many people there loved the film....as did my daughter who saw it with me. As for me, I think the production values were excellent but the ending changed my overall feelings about the movie. Up untl the end, I liked it very, very much....but after the ultra-violent climax, I was left a bit cold. Your experience with the film is really dependent on whether or not you can take the violence and how it impacts you.Instead of talking about the plot and how great or not the film is, I want to focus on the violence. My daughter felt the violence wasn't that extreme and it was needed for the plot. As for me, seeing knives plunged into people at close range and seeing a giant rock smashed ultra-realistically into a person's head just turned my stomach. There could be violence without it being THIS extreme and THIS personal and close-up.So, overall it's still a good film but one I really wish I hadn't seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think.\n",

      "The Kim family leeches off others and lives in a basement apartment. The son Ki-woo gets a job tutoring a young girl. Using a series of lies, each member of the Kim family gets a job at the rich Park family home.I actually found the Kim family too annoying to watch at the beginning. The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up. There are scenes which I can almost smell. This is a very compelling statement about class in society.\n",

      "Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including \"how\" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.\n",

      "When the buddy who got into college tells him he's moving to the US, and he's passing on the 14-year-old he's been tutoring -- just tell 'em you're enrolled in college, even though you aren't -- the son of a family so low class they've sunk through the foundation finds them very nice, very accepting, and very clueless. So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.It's a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror, with a script that handles the theme of the people we don't see because they're not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion. When I saw it in a theater during its New York run, I was impressed. I was convinced it would be nominated for Best Foreign Movie, and might even win!\n",

      "Okay, so these slightly over two hours are \"Parasite\" or \"Gisaengchung\", the original title that probably nobody in Europe or the United States is really aware of. This is one of the biggest players this awards season, also in North America, and that I find really surprising. It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this year. I guess it helps that director Bong Joon-ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past. So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now. Anyway, people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film, I don't think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations. It is decent, maybe good, nothing more. This is the story of a really poor family, unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence (the son's friend) manages to sneak in at a rich family's house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related.You can argue to what extent it is despicable what they are doing because obviously how they remove the limo driver and the maid is really full of intrigue. Still, sometimes I struggled with how realistic it all felt. I mean that it did not. For example that the driver really gets fired or that when hiring the mother as the new maid that the rich husband and wife do not talk about who made the suggestion. And there are more moments like this. It does feel kinda fictitious at times for me, which is a bit of a negative dealbreaker for sure because like I said you can see that this film tried to make a powerful statement. It also sometimes felt too much as if they were taking the idea of a parasite and what it does as too defining like how it kills the host eventually, which is what one man does to the other near the film's end and that really did not feel realistic at all to me. Just showy and for the sake of it because even in his letter he said that he felt sorry for the man and respected him, so if he should have attacked anybody, then I'd say it should have been the guy who lived down there and went rogue before that on everybody, especially the protagonist's family. And also that the son really with all the blood literally pouring out of his head survived the attack as we find out did not feel too likely to me. It was interesting though that it was this big rock he was attacked with that clearly meant something to him as he saved it when everything was under water before that and they had to leave their real home. Karma maybe a bit because they say this big mansion is their new home.Still there are funny moments too. After all this film calls itself a satire. The highlight comedically for me was when they are all under the bed and this scene easily could have gone wrong, but it was hilarious, especially when all except the dad get out, but then the rich family's son calls his parents and he is down there on the ground in the middle of the room, but they don't see him. Don't suspect anything. But before that it is not too respectful how they talk about the man's smell. So they are definitely on the shallow side when (they think) their employees are not nearby. The escalation started really from the moment they let the old housekeeper in the house again. I also wondered why they did. I mean I can see why they opened the door, but then they should have asked what she wants and brought it to her, which of course would not have been possible, but this would have been the approach that made sense in this scenario. Okay what else can I say about this film let me think. The three younger women were all really stunning. Somebody who says Asian women are not particularly attractive should see this film and maybe he will change his mind.I have read people compare this film to Pulp Fiction, but I would not agree with that at all. The ending is as bloody as anything Pulp Fiction has to offer, but this is hardly a criterion I'd say. It felt completely different to me and also slightly inferior at least. Key subjects like religion, absolution, betting, sexual abuse and drugs are not at the center of this film here and brief talk about drugs on one or two occasions does not change that. But kinda ironic that with this comparison the director of this film is going against Tarantino at the Oscars too, even if I am pretty sure BJH is not winning. I am not sure if I like the idea of Tarantino winning the big prize this year and maybe his first Oscar for his direction, but his film is definitely way superior compared to this one here. The other contender is Scorsese and while I think his film is not too bad, I am also not won over by that one as I was by Tarantino's. Scorsese's is roughly on par with Parasite.So to sum it all up, a few more words on Parasite: It has a really nice (almost) sex scene and in general the film was working best for the comedic moments for me. The only thrilling moment in terms of drama that had me on the edge of my seat was when the former maid was walking down this long path and we had no idea what was coming. Maybe people also liked this film so much because you never knew what would happen next and if for example the family was capable of killing the two rich guys (and their kids) in order to experience wealth for years to come. They are ruthless, but are they criminals? Up to you to decide and it is all subjective. Also interesting to see their confidence rise when early on they don't do anything against the guy almost peeing right into their home, but later on they are ready to attack him. So yes, it as an interesting movie that felt shorter than it actually was, but I still must say it was not a great watch and the awards attention is just too much, also for the cast, or basically for the one guy who gets all the acting praise here (the father I think). Still go see this one, just don't go in it with great expectations. I give it a thumbs-up and I am curious to see how it fares at the Golden Globes 2020 that are just about to start five minutes from now.\n",

      "Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that.\n",

      "When Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) is indicated by his best friend, who will travel, as the replacement English tutor of a teenage daughter of the wealthy Park family, he is immediately hired. Soon he foresees the chance to bring his poor unambitious family to work for the family. The Kim family plots a scheme to fire the Park´s driver and the housekeeper and soon his father is hired as driver, his mother as housekeeper and his sister as arts teacher of the wealthy family. When the Park Family travels for camping, they stay in their house as if they were the owners. But soon something happens that will affect the Kim and Park families.\"Gisaengchung\", a.k.a. \"Parasite\", is an original, unconventional and overrated black comedy by the South Korean Bong Joon Ho. The film is good and the plot is funny, dramatic and suspenseful but there is no motive for the hype around this movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Parasita\" (\"Parasite\")\n",
      "\n",
      "A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative.\n",

      "The title is a metaphor to describe the relationship between the rich and the poor. It is a social statement. We are first introduced to the poor Kim family who is street smart. They steal wi-fi and put together pizza boxes. Kevin (Woo-sik Choi ) is introduced to the rich gullible Kim family as an English tutor. He manages through lies to get the rest of his family hired on as the old servants are dismissed. We discover poor people have a disgusting smell to them. They smell like the subway (urine?) The film climaxes ar a birthday party.The film was mildly amusing and clever. It wasn't as funny or entertaining as say, \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" While good, I would say the Oscar as \"best picture\" was a gift.Guide: F-word. groping. no nudity.\n",

      "Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10.\n",

      "Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!\n",

      "This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. \"Parasite\" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it's way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim's weren't able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim's demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It's not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park's. Not that it wasn't done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim's luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim's had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim's from their lucrative positions.I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim's (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can't say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of 'crossing the line' that the Kim's were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it's denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo's survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.As for the ultimate finale, who's to say that Kim-woo's plan to rescue his dad wasn't a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - \"\"If you make a plan, life never works out that way\". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park's, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn't turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year's Best Picture at the Oscars.Addendum**** 2-10-2020 - Well, I'm not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture's chances at the Oscars. It won 'Best Picture' last night in a pretty competitive field. Congratulations!\n",

      "Bong Joon-ho's \"Gisaengchung\" (\"Parasite\" in English) became the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. And it was a deserved win. Like \"Joker\", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic!A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw \"The Host\". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it.\n",

      "I heard about this South Korean a few months before its release, the title itself sounded interesting to me, but I also knew it was predicted to do very well during Awards Season, in fact, it went on make history at the Academy Awards, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer). Basically, the Kim family: father Ki-taek (The Host's Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), live in a small semi-basement apartment, have low-paying temporary jobs, and struggle to get by. Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to bring material wealth to whoever possesses it. Min-hyuk is leaving to study abroad, before leaving he suggests to Ki-woo he should take over his job as an English tutor to the wealthy Park family's daughter, Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Ki-woo poses as a university student and is hired by the Parks; Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) decides to call him Kevin. Subsequently, the Kim family begins to infiltrate the Park family home by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated but sophisticated skilled workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with Da-hye. Ki-jeong poses as \"Jessica\", an art therapist for restless young son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Ki-jeong frames Mr. Park's chauffeur Yoon (Park Geun-rok) for having sex in his car, and suggests her \"uncle\" for the job, so Ki-taek, a former valet, is hired. Finally, the Parks' housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) has a severe allergy to peaches, the Kims exploit this and convince Mrs. Park that she has tuberculosis, and Chung-sook takes over. When the Parks leave to go on a camping trip, the Kim family take advantage, living in the empty luxurious mansion. The former housekeeper unexpectedly returns, claiming left something in the basement. The Kims are shocked as she reveals a hidden entrance to an underground bunker, created by the famous architect and previous owner of the mansion. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon), has been secretly living underneath the home, to hide from loan sharks, for the last four years. After realising the truth about the Kim family, Moon-gwang threatens to tell the Parks their secret if they do not, in turn, keep hers. A brawl breaks out among Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. They are interrupted when Mrs. Park calls, they are returning home early, the trip has been cancelled due to a rainstorm. Geun-sae is dragged back down below, while Moon-gwang is fatally wounded when pushed down the stairs. The two are trapped in the bunker, while the Kim family scramble to clean up their mess. After Chung-sook serves her dinner, Mrs. Park tells about how Da-song had a traumatic experience years ago when he saw a \"ghost\", Geun-sae, emerging from the basement. The remaining Kims hide underneath the sofa in the living room, Mr. Park complains to his wife about a smell, which is Ki-taek. The Kims, after some failed attempts and near misses, eventually manage to escape the Parks' house. Returning to their apartment, they are devastated to find it completely flooded due to the storm and are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other people made homeless. The next day, Mrs. Park decides to host a party for Da-song's birthday. She invites Ki-jeong and Ki-woo, while Ki-taek and Chung-sook are required to be employees. During the party, Ki-woo heads down to the bunker with the scholar's rock intending to kill Geun-sae. After accidentally dropping the rock down the stairs, Geun-sae attacks him, bludgeoning him with the rock and escaping. Seeking revenge for the death of Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jeong with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers a trauma-induced seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out, until Chung-sook kills Geun-sae with a skewer. Ki-taek tries to help Ki-jeong, but Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek takes the kitchen knife and fatally stabs Mr. Park before fleeing the scene. Weeks later, Ki-woo has survived the attack and wakes up from his coma following surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of fraud and put on probation, Ki-jeong is revealed to have died from her injury, and Ki-taek has vanished and is wanted for Mr. Park's murder. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. The Park family home has been sold to German family, but Ki-woo continues to scope it out. He notices the flickering light in the house and recognises it as a message in Morse code. It is a message from Ki-taek, who is now living in the bunker, which he decodes. Still living in the semi-basement apartment, Ki-woo responds to his father, vowing to one day earn enough money to buy the house, free his father, and the family will be reunited. The film's title is a double meaning, it can refer to the poor family manipulating their way into the lives of the rich family, or the rich family themselves in terms of labour, leeching off others to do to the work, it could also refer to the sinister character beneath the house. This film works well as a satirical and intricate examination of class conflict, and as a film of two halves. The sneaky set-up is a savage social commentary with an impoverished family conning their way up, and then it completely shifts gear with a darker tone and surprising moments that will get under the skin. It is the first film from South Korea to gain Oscar nominations, it became the first foreign language film in history to win the top prize at the Academy Awards (beating big contender 1917 from Sam Mendes), and the first to win Best Picture and the foreign language category together. At a time where the lack of diversity is debated, this film will hopefully pave the way for changes, it is a fantastic dark comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han, and Best International Feature Film (formerly Best Foreign Language Film), and it was nominated for Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!\n",

      "This Oscar winning Korean film is centred on the Kim family; they live in a distinctly downmarket neighbourhood and struggle to earn enough money. One day a friend of Ki-woo, the son, tells him of a job opportunity; the wealthy Park family need an English tutor for their teenaged daughter. Equipped with forged qualifications he gets the job, not only that he suggests that his sister, Ki-jung, who he introduces as a cousin of a friend would be the ideal art tutor for their son. It isn't long before Father, Ki-taek, and mother, Chung-sook, are also employed as driver and housekeeper... all this is done in a way that doesn't give away that they know each other. Things are looking up for the Kims as they enjoy their new situation; then the old house keeper, who they got fired, returns and their new success is threatened in a surprising way.This film is hard to pigeonhole; it is a comedy that provides plenty of laughs; it is a social commentary of the vast difference in wealth in Korean society; it toys with horror tropes; there is some romance; and has violent moments. It could have turned out to be a real mess but the elements blend together almost perfectly. The cast does a really fine job making the characters believable even when the situation is far-fetched. For the most part it is set within the Park's large, modern house; the only other location of note it the contrastingly small basement flat the Kim's call home... the comparison emphasises who different the families' circumstances are. The story provides some twists, which I won't spoil here; these often lead to a shift in tone... even when things turn darker in tone there are still laughs to be had. Director Bong Joon-ho, who also co-wrote the story, does a great job as the film treads the fine line between brilliance and silliness... always keeping on just the right side. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something a little different.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles.\n",

      "A down-on-their-luck, low-class family con their way into the employ of a rich household, but events turn sinister after they find a secret in the basement.Maybe I've just seen too many really messed up movies from the far East, but at the half-way point of Parasite, which sees the discovery of a hidden bunker and an unexpected inhabitant lurking within, I hoped that matters would get seriously twisted in the way that only Asian cinema can; but while things certainly get dark, the film is not nearly as edgy, or as bizarre, or as wild as the premise suggests.The initial plot twists and turns are deftly handled by director Bong Joon-ho, there are some superbly executed scenes of tension, the performances are great, the cinematography is lovely, and the film's social commentary on how different classes view and treat each other allows for plenty of delicious satire, but the second half of the film still feels frustratingly restrained in terms of sheer audacity. Restrained, and incredibly drawn out, Bong Joon-ho letting too many scenes drag their heels, with the ending taking an eternity to arrive.In short, definitely worth a watch, but a serious contender for best picture? Surely not.\n",

      "My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. I wouldn't normally be drawn to a Korean movie with English subtitles, and with a name like \"Parasite\", but because it won the Oscar recently for Best Picture, it seemed like a worthy viewing.Well we found it very worthwhile. The story is pretty novel, it focuses on a family of four, dad, mom, son, and daughter, all living in a basement of sorts in a slum area and scratching for enough money to buy food each day. Definitely a lower class existence but also seemingly bright and well educated.By good fortune the son is asked to become an English tutor for a teenage girl when his friend, the current tutor, is heading off to college. When he shows up he is fascinated by the fabulous home of this upper class family, the dad is a big executive and wealthy. The family hires a live-in maid, a driver, and tutors for the two children.Quickly the tutor sees an opportunity and eventually all four of the lower class family members cooperate in a scheme. By different approaches they will cause all the hired help to be dismissed, being replaced by the various members of their family but hiding the fact that they are in fact family members. In essence they become parasites, sucking money off the wealthy family.Of course things don't go smoothly for long, and things get really mucked up after the former maid returns to retrieve something she left in the basement. As I watched into the second half of the movie I was wondering how all this would work its way through and found the filmaker had a very interesting approach, in the very end not everything is resolved and one can decide what eventually happened.Really good movie, the dialog is pretty quick at times and you have to read subtitles pretty quickly but overall it wasn't too big of a task.\n",

      "There's been some anger over this movie winning an Academy Award. It's hard for me to judge if a movie deserves to be considered the best film of the year, because the majority of movies that I love always end up being Italian end of the world movies or Mexican ripoffs of American horror tropes. Who am I to judge quality, I asked into the abyss, ignorant of the fact that I've created an entire site where I do exactly that.The idea for Parasite comes from Bong's own experience: he was a tutor for a wealthy family and imagined what it would be like to infiltrate their life. The title, which the director argued for, has a dual meaning. Sure, the poor servants are living off of the rich, but the masters are living off the labor class. They've lost the ability to clean and even move around for themselves. Everyone is a parasite in their own way.Instead of taking an existing home, the house was specially made for the film. That's because each character has a place that belongs to them and another place that is secret to them. Boon also spent considerable time storyboarding the entire film, as he believes that he must be ready for everything before the cameras start capturing footage.There's a phrase in South Korea called Hell Joseon. It means many things - unemployment, economic inequality, excessive work hours, the fact that poverty is inescapable for the lower class and that the system is rigged for the rich - but it generally means that life is hellish and hopeless.This is not a phrase that is unique to South Korea.What spoke most to me is that the history of the world - major battles and the plight of Native Americans - have been reduce to party table formations and the hobbies of disconnected children. The poor have been reduced to, at best, slave labor and at worst, ghosts. A ghost that appears to ruin the illusion that money and status seems to afford, but any man, no matter his station, can ruin and end the life of another.I've always realized that no matter how good or bad your life is, there are always people with a status above and below you. But I'll lean in and show you my hand. If there is any group that I'm prejudiced against, it's the rich. Yet it's hard to be for the family in this movie, as their machinations only prove that when they get the status they want - even for one fleeting night as they steal whiskey and a view of a yard that can never be theirs - they still hold down and destroy the lives a level beneath their own, only to then learn that their home has been flooded and taken away.There is no escape for any of the Kim family. The ways that they try to defeat the system through their attempts at grifting. But the system was built by people with far less scruples and morals. The home that promise luxury is also a prison, offering none of the comforts that Ki-taek dreams of, only a place to sneak out of at night and take his own life in his hands just to steal food.At the end of the film, I felt worry for each character and knew they were all doomed in their own way. They are all trapped, whether by death or hope or the house itself. No one gets a happy ending, even if we wished for one to come true. Is having hope in the midst of Hell Joseon worth it? I'd like to think so, even as this film doesn't.Is it the best film of the year? Is it worth the hype? Is it worth watching? I can't answer the first two questions, but definitely can say yes to the third. It takes time to get to the point when the staircase to the basement is revealed, but the movie had me from that moment.It did make me think, as all good movies should. Is everyone a parasite, unable to function alone in this world? Should a father's pride come in the way of his freedom? Should children be overindulged? How crazy is Morse code? These are the real questions I had.\n",

      "Since it won the Oscar for Best Picture, Mom and I were curious about watching this Korean film and we finally did today after I checked this out from the library. The verdict: It's interesting how the picture goes to various places concerning the poor family being employed by the rich one and then also a surprise concerning an eventual former employee of the rich family with a secret... Mom wasn't so enamored of the story because it didn't have a happy ending and I, well, I admire the way it was written, performed, and filmed but, yeah, I didn't love it. But it's a unique enough piece of work so that's something of a recommendation...\n",

      "This film tells the story of a family that stops at nothing to achieve what they want in life.This is a really good story that keeps me at the edge of my seat, even though there is nothing adrenaline inducing. The suspense is quite chilling, and I jus cannot wait to find out what will happen in the end. It is a sad and thought provoking story, which begs for much deep analysis and soul searching.\n",

      "The Park family is the epitome of riches. The Kim's dwell in a subbasement and live off of assembling pizza boxes. By sheer fate, these two families are brought together. Masterminded by college-aged Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik) and his sister (Park-So-dam), the Kim children , gets the unexpected opportunity to get work as an English tutor and an art therapist for the Park family children. Unbeknownst to the wealthy family, the Kim's father is hired as chauffeur to the aloof businessman Mr. Park, while Ki-Woo realizes he can, by hook and crook, get his own mother hired to fill a newly opening for housekeeper. The Kim's are providing services while the Parks become the whole bankroll for the parasitic Kim family. The golden opportunity becomes unsteady when underhanded dominance raises its head.Bong Joon-ho's tragicomedy is nearly flawless and deserves its many awards highlighted by the Golden Globes and Oscars. PARASITE makes the Silver Screen a remarkable experience.\n",

      "That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way. I reminded another movie from 2013 and Netherlands called BORGMAN, very close about the topic and even more weird; try it if you can. I prefered BORGMAN, but that one if far better brilliant, bloody, ironic, cynical.\n",

      "I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie. The premiss that a family of grifters manage to infiltrate a pretty vacuous wealthy family by pretending to be, initially, a qualified English teacher, then an off-the-wall art teacher; a chauffeur and finally a housekeeper is original, funny and harmless. The humorous and mischievous way the family gel with their ambitions for a better life is a testament to the excellent performances from the four the principal characters. Regrettably, however, the second half descends quite rapidly into a farcical story that drags it down. Their harmless deception takes on a far more sinister - and implausible - guise as we quite literally discover (living) bodies under the stairs. It's now almost slapstick; ultimately violent and Bong Joon Ho now just seems to have lost his way. Yeo-jeong Jo is good, too, as the wealthy wife and I would heartily highly recommend this film, but it is - in my opinion - nowhere near as good as \"Mother\".\n",

      "He grins, and bows a little bow\n",
      "'So sorry, this MY garden now'.That verse by Ogden Nash, itself a satire, may well contain the nucleus of Parasite, a movie in which nothing is sacred and anything goes. I am unable to put my hand on my heart and agree with the Academy that it was the Best Picture of 2019 but I can say that it was far from the worst. Most viewers in the West, of course, were obliged to rely on subtitles to follow the story and while subtitles have never been a problem for me I always feel a slight sense of loss if a given piece of art is not written in my first language; if, for example, I am watching, say, Uncle Vanya, sitting next to a native Russian speaker, and the English translation is the finest possible I still feel that the native speaker is getting ten or twenty per cent more out of the play than I am via untranslatable nuances. So it was with Parasite but what remains is highly enjoyable.\n",
