no discrimination , but stay loyal to the caracter i undrerstand the need to be equal in life and i respect that highly , but this franchise and caracter itself is something which is wreten for the male role , as the role , emotions , dramatic moments , etc are beter expresed through male role and only can be acted as a male role i know that the producers tried to experiment in the movie with the feelings of the viewers puting the female , or other gender as 007 and i will tell them , please no , do not do that you will deminish tradition 60 years old and for all of us loyal to the caracter of bond , from conery to craig it will be emotional distress thank you !
amazing ending to an amazing bond i truly believe this is the best bond film of all time daniel craig has been a truly believable , rugged bond with a psychotic slant to his character his motorbike stunts , his dry sense of humour and his really believable storylines made me truly sad to wave goodbye to this era of james bond
still the beginning here 's my reviewbeginning 10 10 , it 's fair to judge this movie like this spectre was so boring but this , let me tell you , lit as hell this movie is a should to watch for sure
ada it was a beautiful tragedy , my relationship with not the ucm , but with the ucm structure it was a beautiful mess in historical tradition , unlike the master of the universe , the ucm , or time of surface , the ucm structure was a mess up \( so far , history and chronology is on my side you 'll see in a few moments what i mean \) and it was a once upon a time \( and now art 's chronology , the bookend is on my side \) she is the magic l , in outer space she was for a time she is n't sandy hook , who is the actual woman in blue she is the flash artist , which is just a reference to lightning strikes \( sex aristocracy 's smoking and the weather 's variety too \) she was a friend , and mentor , of the cartoon for kids ucm structure robot i 've done enough , to get my hands on the magic l time and its bookend both supported me , and when symmetry is had , anything is no bad my desire , is to insert the following principle , which i took from no time to die substance as no worth , as inverse of purpleby h ollywood tradition , the colour theory of the universe , represented mainly by adamski from amityville 2 , brittney havers , from wild things 2 , janice from annabelle creation and by alex cross from kiss the girls , is that green and purple pink are the polar opposites they are the each ends of the spectrum , of the game of colours green is good , but worthless , pink is aia bad , but lethal \( symmetry 's no bad bad , but lethal \) what do you notice , about the word substance \? do you notice that it looks green \? not sounds green , or feels green , but looks green ada 's paloma was the ingredient , in the story , that taught me to look up up is still up , but , look as at up means oo , which means infinity infinity is 2d , which is just no judgement , ergo , no up or down , but a stretch the magic l
incredible conclusion no time to die is an incredible conclusion to daniel craig 's strong run as 007 that 's suitably epic , thrilling and fun whilst also being surprisingly extremely emotional and tying up as many loose ends as it can daniel craig is reliably perfect once again with plenty of charisma l a seydoux , lashana lynch , ben whishaw , ralph fiennes and jeffrey wright are all great rami malek is really good and ana de armas is also great in her small part cary joji fukunaga 's direction is fantastic , it 's beautifully filmed , extremely stylish and visually slick with amazing action scenes it 's well paced and the music by hans zimmer is phenomenal , full of subtle callbacks and some new additions that are all time classics the song by billie eilish is excellent
bond is back no time to die was awesome i loved every last minute of it the action and stunt work was a lot of fun thank you daniel craig for 15 years of memories as 007 you forever my james bond
best bond film of craig 's era watch it for daniel craig i can strongly say this is the best and top class entertaining instalment in bond franchise cary fukunaga used craig so perfectly in this conclusion his performance alone will make this film a worth watch the music and score was excellently composed by hans zimmer so far this is the best camera work i 've seen in recent times and of course fukunaga 's direction is unbelievably top class i never expected this from a director who only made couple of mainstream hollywood movie every frames in this film will bring back the nostalgia of bond franchise to you if ur a true bond fan while also a tasteful movie watcher then probably u 'll love this one maybe this movie felt a bit longer but still worth the running time 007 mission completed in a magnificent manner
best james bond ever ! ! this movie is so good from the insane action to the character development it 's a great conclusion to a saga at one point it has you on the edge of seat as james bond is killing hordes of people to crying at the end , of the time you had with character amazing conclusion ! !
spoilers spoiler warning i am writing this quick review at 06 30 on the day after seeing the film , i had to , as i cant sleep , my mind cant forget the emotion at the end of the film i turned to steph and said rather loudly they have f killed james bond how can any future film match the emotions of that daniel craig has done what no baddie could do in 60 years but has he also killed the golden egg , the whole franchise \? \? how can i ever watch casino royale or any bond film knowing , they killed james bond so daniel u returned to kill james bond , why \? \? \? is this why danny boyle done a runner \? how can any future film any future actor match that \? \? \? bond is 60 next year , so am i , i grew up with bond , am a massive fan , craig is my favourite bond , casino royale was my favourite film , but now do i hate craig \? is nttd the best or worst film \? did i ever think i would leave the cinema crying as we all were \? never this is why they wanted it on a big screen so much with am audience , on your tv it would not have had that emotion and also most people will go back to the cinema and watch it again to try to handle what craig has done this film will make money as people who are not big fans will have 2 see it for themselves to believe what they have been told and kudos to everyone who worked on that film keeping quiet yes there were rumours but it was only in the last few scenes that i actually believed they were going there and they did the missiles and let me tell you a story about bond james bond time to listen to the soundtrack and i def have to return to piz gloria the bond between nttd and ohmss will last forever as one review said it will be hard to forget the power of no time to die 's ending james bond is dead ,
daniel craig 's last run if you love bond movies like myself then you will love this one ! as usual from beginning to end the movie offers great acting , awesome action sequences , bond trademarked moves , and will have you feeling many of your emotions by the end of the movie ! it 's definitely a must see !
thank you daniel ! a huge farewell to the best james bond in history of the role a very heartbreaking end in a perfect movie a lot of fans hated daniel craig and a lot loved him as james bond i belong in the second category but in the end it will be very hard for everyone to 'fill' his shoes as james bond
better than expected this worth time to watch perhaps this is the best action movie this year
this is the best thing ever for the first time ever , after 6 years from the last film of spectre , daniel craig 's conclusion is one of the best and finest and the most exciting ones out of any series ever had the previous bond 's had departures that are seemingly disappointing or left in a cliffhanger you must definitely see it , since i will not reveal any detail , you must have to watch it on your own
a bond master piece a fantastic end to daniel 's last bond outing the story flows perfectly to end off storie line definitely the best bond movie in my eyes
i love it thank you daniel craig for these 15 years ! for myself , this is craig 's best bond it 's really emotional bond movie great action , good editing and hans zimmer 's music is beautiful a great ending for craig 's bond films i still understand the people who put skyfall and casino royale ahead of this but right now , this is what i think is the best bond movie time will tell how long it will stay there
this is a good film , through and through i reserve my 10 star rating for the exceptional piece the action starts early and this is going to be good is going through my mind however , the emotions of the film as well as it 's plot and intelligence are nearly as significant to its exceptionalism as the action
the best bond movie ever ! the movie had everything , great plot , amazing performances and depth seriously was incredible
loved it ! classic feel emotional risks ! no time to die hit the same notes on her majesty 's secret service did years ago literally using the same soundtrack lol so the ending was no shocker to me appreciated
very good this is a perfectly written movie to end the daniel era it wraps up the story nicely and sets up for future movies being a lifelong 007 fan this leave the universe open
no time die tries to do some innovation and i like it seeing all the negative reviews here , i decided to leave a positive one i went to the cinema on the release date of the movie and i must say i was thoroughly impressed this is definitely a better movie than spectre it was a whole emotional rollercoaster , from the beginning to the end there were great action scenes \( and my favourite are the scenes in italy and cuba \) , good pacing between the action scenes and some very witty jokes that i really enjoyed what i do n't get is that some people do n't get that daniel craig is n't trying to be the bond that existed 30 or 50 years ago he is totally different he gives the series much more suspense , a more emotional dark touch and takes things more seriously he also is not the terminator , he can still make jokes and i love the interactions between him , m and q also in this movie the chemistry between him and the new 007 agent is also something unexplored and very sensitive for some people apparently i like the chemistry between him and lashana lynch \( who plays the new 007 agent which she respectfully gives back to him near the end of the movie \) i ended up in tears at the end when he died he sacrificed himself for his family again something new , unexplored territory he has a secret daughter that he did n't know about for 5 years i liked this because at least i did not watch something i 've seen more than a hundred times already in the previous bond movies to conclude my review i like that this bond movie like almost all the other daniel craig bond movies tries to do something new and innovative that 's why i come to the cinema , i like to see things evolve not just stay the way they are for like almost 60 years now since the first bond movie released
best bond film ever ! masterpiece ! everything from the beginning til the end has deeper meaning than anyone could ever imagine ! masterpiece ! the acting , the music , the story ! everything is connected and it has a point ! what a movie ! i will watch it over and over and over again ! i did n't like daniel 's role until now ! beautiful ! the movie is one of the best i 've seen ! did n't believe that nowadays someone can make something so special ! ! ! !
competes with casino royale and sky fall for best bond ! this movie is simply amazing , from the cinematography to dialogue it ticks all the boxes and more bond is more human than ever and whilst some diehard fans may take negatively to that character arc it helps audiences to connect and really feel his pain it loses one star due to pacing which i thought could 've been done slightly better , otherwise the movie is near perfect i really hope this does do well in the box office as it is deserving of all the praise its receiving and more only thing i dislike is the backstory to savin 's character as his motivations are not really made clear and he is not utilised properly i feel that if they gave him more to do he would 've potentially become the best bond villain to date all in all definitely recommend seeing in the cinema
this was the only way it could ever end it was an ending a good ending for bond 's life \( craig 's bond \) the visuals and action were perhaps a bit underwhelming but concluding the character was done with extreme skill and great thought
well a lot of people make charts with which bond movie is the best , which actor , some focus on the action , others on the story , and so on i will not place this one against the others , but i would say , for me it was a complete well made bond movie that moved me 10 stars cheers !
great ending to an era great ending to a great era it comes in second , behind casino royal by far it 's better than skyfall purely based on emotions the storytelling is amazing , it 's well shot and the sound effects are breathtaking 10 10 recommended for the big screen
best bond ever daniel craig 's ushered james bond into the 21st century by making him a more believable nuanced character no other actor except timothy dalton attempted this for fear of alienating a devoted fan base some say sean connery was the best bond but undoubtedly it is daniel craig by the time 'no time to die' comes over we see bond almost willing to give up his frenetic and luckless life as a secret agent and that only seems plausible this is n't the regular smirk shoot and kiss spy storyline that most bond fans look for but it is also the most relatable another unusual shade to this excellent film is its emotional quotient this is a very emotional bond film that will unusually give you a moist eye even the opening song is unusually 25 minutes into the movie and is by far one of the most emotional bond themes after spectre 's theme it is a beautifully made film and deserves more praise than it does for a strong storyline and excellent acting from the supporting cast and craig himself
best 007 in the series ! ! this movie was awesome from start to finish ! ! i loved the way it ended daniel craig is by far my favourite bond actor and i 've seen them all so sad that 007 died in the end but if he has to go best to save his family and the world
perfect send off to the greatest james bond could n't ask for a better ending to daniel craig 's 15 years as james bond
sing ed up to do this review have n't reviewed before , but had to sign up to make amends for the current rating of 7 6 this is maybe my favourite bond film and deserves to be averaging high 8 's at least time will be kind to this film , and i believe the lower rating is due to reviewers unable to handle that the film does n't stick to the standard bond formula the film is all the better for it , and i would put it up with casino royale , or skyfall go see it , and decide for yourself
the best daniel craig forever 007 the best james bond movie
take a bow mr craig , take a bow ! daniel craig 's swansong as james bond taking place five years after the events of spectre , we find craig has quit the secret service , broken off things w lea seydoux \( due to a belief she had betrayed him \) but as the running time dictates , we know craig will suit up one more time \( accompanied humorously by lashana lynch who becomes the new 007 much to craig 's chagrin \) to fight off a new foe , played by oscar winner rami malek , who has his own axe to grind against blofeld 's \( once again played by christoph waltz \) horde \( they killed his family years ago \) manages to decimate their ranks directed by cary joji fukunaga \( beasts of no nation sin nombre \) , who i believe may be the first yank to direct a bond entry \( remember when pierce brosnan wanted quentin tarantino to direct one the bond producers said no \) w his usual expert eye on composition framing w an ending which is wholly satisfying to craig 's arc throughout his reign \( i would n't want to be in the planning room for where bond goes next \) also starring ralph fiennes as m , ben whishaw as q , naomie harris as miss moneypenny , rory kinnear as tanner last but certainly not least ana de armas jeffrey wright as a cuban agent felix leiter respectively
maybe the best bond so far , love the character progression one of the best if not the best bond movie i saw character transformation from first daniel craig bond role to the last one neat , aggressive yet emotional loved every second of it excellence in every detail of production from casting actors , clothes , cars , soundtrack , production , amazing locations , neat and not to flashy it shows how bond serial went to the right direction after first casting craig and going with the story probably his best role in bond movies sad to see him leave but excited to see where the story goes after this it 's hard to find actors that are that neat , aggressive and sarcastic at the same time
really good bond movie watched this today and it is an excellent bond movie even my wife who is n't the biggest bond fan thought it was excellent a great finale for daniel craig , top film
brilliant this is the best that daniel craig has achieved as bond 2 hours and 43 minutes went by in the blink of an eye action almost all the way good story and superbly acted by daniel craig and the cast
terrific newly retired james bond and bride madeleine are enjoying scenic travelling despite the secrets they both know the other has those secrets blow the couple apart and bond goes off the grid until well , reasons it is difficult to give much plot commentary without risking spoilers and , of all the bonds , this has more potential for spoilers than any of them so let me mention specific but non plot items the opening sequence is the most genuinely chilling sequence in any bond film the multiple nods to previous bond both books and films \( dialogue , music , set design etc \) are affectionate and organic rather than knowing nudges new director cary joji fukanaga shows that sam mendes does n't have a monopoly on making bond movies look gorgeous lea seydoux , reprising an underwritten madeleine , is spectacularly good ana de armas features in a sequence which is huge fun , but it 's not too difficult to recognise that it was shoehorned in at a late stage , because 2 lines of dialogue would have sufficed to replace it in the story and perhaps it is fair to comment that a feature of the craig bonds has been each film revealing another layer like nesting russian dolls , and the baddie here has an air of being added to extend the saga after an effective full ending at the conclusion of spectre but i'm not complaining because , following craig 's decision to ok , i 'll do another one but no more , this is a good , good end to his five bond films and i'm now prepared to say that his bond is the best screen bond my reason for this is that his is the only bond who has been a human being capable of cold suppression of emotion in order to do his job , but a real person nonetheless the other bonds have all been actors playing characters i choked up at the music choice over the closing credits
a finale so stunning , and poetically grandiose that you will simply never see what 's coming a b i g screen mini review film seen sept 30 , '21 q can i just have one nice evening please , before the world explodes said to 'james bond' and 'miss moneypenny' , at q 's london residence this was taken from an official preview for no time to die , \( to be referred to as nt2d in this review \) , is by no means , 'a spoiler' 1 the overall calibre of acting here , given that this is , at the end of the day , a 'blockbuster popcorn flick' , is well truly breathtaking spearheading the dazzling array of world class acting talent that is on full display in nt2d are the following three absolute cinematic icons a hollywood veteran l a seydoux arguably best known for 'blue is the warmest colour' 'ghost protocol' 'spectre' who plays the deeply damaged , yet independent , ravishing lovely psychotherapist , 'madeleine swann' she renders a delicate and impassioned performance , that is nothing short of mesmerizing b rami malik , a k a 'lyutsifer safin' , the movie 's primary of two classic megalomaniacal bond villains on account of the character 's having been \( very \) badly scarred as a vulnerable , young child rami succeeds handily in providing the most idiosyncratically delectabe portrayal of the 'never before seen' baddie , that you could ever possibly hope to see c 'the man of the hour' himself of course , daniel craig , who did actually catch me somewhat off guard managing to completely 'wow' , with both his utterly stupendous 'physical' performance and his genuinely superb dramatic , emotional delivery 2 cary who \? you could very easily be forgiven for never having heard of cary joji fukunaga , the formerly relatively unknown , yet multigifted actor producer writer cinematographer director , who , in the september of 2018 was officially and publicly awarded the globally mega coveted job of not only directing nt2d , but of co writing its whole script screenplay , as well the reason i say mega coveted is due to the 'particularly' high profile nature of this specific cinematic venture not only is it eon productions' grand 25th bond offering but it is also daniel craig 's unequivocal grand final outing as the universally adored superspy \( based on widely known statements made by the actor , himself \) and it 's no wonder , frankly , that mr fukunaga was given such a totally 'goliath project' , given the fact that only the very second complete picture that he \( ever \) directed , executive produced and co wrote 'victoria para chino' or 'victory for chino' 13 minutes 2004 new york university student movie went on to not only win the 'best student narrative short' oscar award for the year 2005 but also pretty much sweep the deck clean by winning a whopping 4 of the 5 other \( major \) awards that the said 'short' was nominated for , in that very same year 3 final analysis every now and then , along comes a film with the capacity to altogether , and most unexpectedly m o v e the viewer , \( me , as well as my family , in this instance \) , to their very core a deep heartfelt thank you is in order to you , cary joji fukunaga , to your 'viscerally beautiful' movie 's entire ensemble cast , your uber talented crew and most of all to your leading man , daniel craig for so successfully having enthralled us to this degree yes , i sha n't deny that i would have loved to see a lot more screen time given to both 'the completely tantalizing ana de armas' , as well as the 'ever endearing jeffrey wright' 'paloma' 'felix leiter' , respectively but hey , i am no less grateful for the undeniably mind blowing experience that i just had a full blown , unabashed 25 marks out of 10 and yes , my word is indeed my bond
fitting send off for daniel craig 's james bond a very fitting send off to daniel craig 's stint as james bond the action scenes are fantastic , plus add in those exotic , international locations that the bond movies are known for i 've seen all of craig 's bond movies and they were all good dark , gritty and yet stylish and visually impressive at times ana de armas had a short but scene stealing and memorable appearance in the movie i liked the worldwide threat they came up in this movie , nanobots that can be programmed to only selectively kill certain people they really found a way to make the threat understandable and an integral part of bond 's actions at the end of the movie a must see movie for me , one of the best of 2021
excellent finish for 007 than going into details if no one has yet to see this film , there is plenty of action and once again daniel craig shows he will always be james bond i personally enjoyed the story from start to finish whoever takes over as bond will have some big shoes to fill for me this is a good ending to craig 's 5 films and if they never did another film , i be satisfied than giving away the ending , it was powerful ending that got me like no other james bond film has i hope that anyone may see it will get the same feelings as i had
impressed the best 007 film with the best bond who ever played him my bow and gratitude go to everyone who was responsible for this highlight in film history this film is the visually stunning increase of superlatives in all aspects an emotional impact that very few films are able to achieve craig is now definitely number 1
'no time to die' is stunning ! i should n't write reviews the moment i 've finished the film , largely because opinions change and vary and develop after mulling things over but having seen all the reviews that imdb have deigned to list first \( despite this film having received predominantly brilliant reviews ! \) , i feel the need to defend it for maybe that one reader who finds this on an internet scroll \) let me start by saying 'no time to die' is a beautiful film it is completely and utterly stunning it 's difficult to sum up what james bond means to you if you are a massive fan \( sorry , some melodramatic stuff coming up \) and i consider myself one i watched all 24 films very close together during a time of personal crisis they were instrumental in helping me heal , so i'm quite attached to this series and i loved 'no time to die' what 's all this about it being too politicised \? i certainly agree with the apprehensiveness the trailer made it look very politicised the film itself is completely devoid of any gender identity politics \( thank christ \) you know those two women in the trailer who looked really arrogant and nasty , seeking basically to dumb bond down for being a male chauvinist \? turns out the trailer cut out all the scenes where bond held his own against them , and it also cut out the scenes where those two women turn out to be two of the coolest characters in all of bond you will love them both by the end \( they 're not even in it as much as you 'll expect \) that 's the political side of things out of the way now let 's get onto the storytelling 'no time to die' is bold very bold indeed plot twists , story developments , and breathtaking finales occur that would never have made it into a typically 'escapist' bond film i love the roger moore 70s era does n't everyone \? but it 's fair to say that those films feel almost like episodes in a tv series they tick along entertaining the masses and that 's fine 'no time to die' is not that it 's an emotional rollercoaster ! you will come out of it feeling in shock and possibly a little numbed \( so do n't go on imdb and give it a terrible review to make yourself feel better \) things happen in 'no time to die' that would categorically never happen in a roger moore one and yet it is still a bond film a bond film through and through gunfights , car chases , gorgeously filmed action sequences , fabulous locations , action packed final battles , larger than life characters , hilarious dialogue \( thank you phoebe waller bridge \) it 's all there bond is still at the centre stage you 've gone to see a bond film and you will get one it 's bold , yes , and very different from the 'norm' , but it is still a film about that fantastic character who we all know and love i will ardently defend this please go and see it
a love letter to james bond it had the beautiful cars , beautiful women , beautiful locations and \( no spoilers \) a beautiful ending could it have ended a different way \? perhaps but all in all a wonderful movie , a definite must see !
very emotionally charged it took me two viewings to really appreciate this bond movie i definitely understood it better with subtitles turned on , not just because my hearing is n't perfect , but because every bit of the dialogue for this one is equally as important as the cinematography on a third viewing , after i 'd fully grasped the narrative , it totally turned around my rating \( from 6 10 to 10 10 \) for this very different portrayal of bond , which delves deep into his character a bit woke in places , but a real tear jerker ending more so because we not only lost bond at the end but the the very best james bond daniel craig wonderful title sequence and musical score too it 's a bit of a shock to the system to see bond portrayed like this but give it a chance to shine , with a second viewing
momentous ending i could write at length about the plot twists , running time but it would all be a waste basically in my humble opinion this outing is the best bond film ever even surpassing skyfall the ending befits the character created by daniel craig and is fitting right a heart felt thanks to all involved in the making of this truly amazing film watch it please you will not be disappointed
no words i was mesmerised and amazed after watching the movie daniel craig will be missed as james bond 007
i love daniel craig as james bond great ending , but would have liked a different ending i always thought daniel craig was great as james bond , and do n't understand the haters at all i liked the way casino royal was done \( the last film with pierce brosnan was just ridiculous , and more of a comedy \) the five films with daniel craig fit completely into today 's time , and his realization of james bond was special harder , but also more human and emotional it 's a pity that it 's over now
brilliant ending for mr craig really not sure what the people who are rating this movie are seeing must be a different movie to me ! i'm guessing they are the old fans who still want james bond in jet packs made of tin foil ! and lasers slowly rising between his legs ! it 's called moving with the times which this movie does ! and brings a conclusion to the best bond ever daniel craig ! not the oldies
loved it i just loved it everything about it from the beginning to the end you just have it all in no time to die and a perfect finish to daniel craig as 007
very well bonded to the bond legacy it 's not remotely woke , as some misguided online influencers have suggested , and is totally and utterly , every inch a superb bond film and just a brilliant genre piece for the action adventure movie crowd it 's instantly one of my favourite bond films and action films of all time the whole hullabaloo about the 007 number going to lashana lynch 's character is a total non issue that seems to have been blown out of proportion by some online influencers trolling for cheap clicks the fact is james bond is still james bond , even when he 's retired , and his agent number is obviously given to somebody else all the performances have that heightened bond feel , the direction by cary joji fukunaga is extremely inspired and exhilarating , the sound effects pop and crunch and just have a real meaty feel , the music stirs , and all the actresses glamour up the screen as you would expect from a bond film special mention to ana de armas 's all too brief character , who was equal parts badass and adorable just a total babe who lit up the screen with infectious positive energy and again , daniel craig 's and everybody else 's performances were all great fun to watch , as well as for the cinematography by linus sandgren , it is up there with the best looking pictures in the history of movies just absolutely beautiful composition and camera movement mixed with precision editing in summing up , it 's a great time at the theatre \( particularly if you see it in a cinema with those extra special speakers \) all the collaborators of the film should be very proud in sending daniel craig off in such stirring and inspiring fashion
a perfect movie ! for james bond an exquisite production , with the best taste in design , scenery , photography and acting cast an incredible direction from cary joji fukunaga who is becoming more and more one of my favorite directors but above all the scenes my favorite is the first 20 minutes of the film , it is a masterpiece to the super , to the drama and to the action long live this british spy , thanks daniel for being agent 007 your movies will be seen for years !
excellent ! ! you have to watch it ! nuff said we will miss you daniel craig , your my james bond with that said , great way to end his era except for the ending not sure if i agree with way it ended would have loved more of a way to keep the same world and build upon it with a new 007 and no not the female way , even though she was bad ass
b25 delivers an extremely fitting encore for daniel craig 's 007 \( regaining his 00 status eventually \) , and a more mature storyline than expected yes we had the car chases , explosives , hand to hand combat and wry quips that we expect from our favourite spy but we also had a great story for these to hang off , with good character development and surprises that certainly blew one away i 've been a fan of bond from very early on , and have found craig 's tenure to be refreshing he may not carry the glint in his eye that connery had , or the delivery of a double entendres of moore what has brought is a menacing presence and vulnerability to the role that fits with the role at nearly 3 hours this is a long movie , but wow it passed by great effort from the screenwriters and eon a fitting finale
craig's finest turn as bond and an brilliant film ! cary joji fukunaga 's dramatic , action packed , moving extravaganza gives a royal farewell to daniel craig 's kickass james bond series of films it concerns a retired james bond , brilliantly played by daniel craig with real conviction , who is living and enjoying a tranquil life in jamaica with his beautiful wife madeline , wonderfully played by lex seydoux , but this is short lived when his old cia friend felix leiter , superbly played by jeffrey wright , appears and asks for his help to find a kidnapped scientist , but this covert mission is more treacherous then expected when bond discovers a complex plot involving a mysterious scarred face sociopathic villain named lyutsifer safin , effectively played by oscar winner rami malek in a truly creepy performance , who possesses a super lethal dna altering bioweapon that threatens the entire world terrific direction by fukunaga who gives his film stunning action sequences that are truly jaw dropping , exceptional supporting performances by ralph fiennes as m , ben whishaw as q , rory kinnear as tanner , naomie harris as moneypenny , christoph waltz as biofeld , with special kudos to lashana lynch as nomi the new no nonsense 007 female agent and ana de armas as the gorgeous and deadly cia agent paloma breathtaking cinematography by linus sandgren , with an evocative score by hans zimmer , and a haunting grammy award winning title song which was written and beautifully sung by billie eilish i totally enjoyed and was highly entertained by this expertly crafted epic film which is a perfect swan song to daniel craig 's sensational 15 year tenure as james bond throughout 5 films , and his impressive farewell performance delivers on all levels highly recommended
masterpiece ! the most bondish movie of the craig era ! ! ! the direction and cinematography of this movie is excellent no time to die pays tribute to the whole craig era and gets the emotional ending it deserves !
must watch ! this is an absolute must watch and an amazing end to daniel craigs run as bond , james bond
rip james bond this last bond movie was very good and had alot of action in it although it was sad that james died on that island and he was n't able to make it alive and he had time to escape the island but he was poisoned and hurt i was shocked about bond 's death and this is the last bond film brosnan , connery and moore were great bonds and love all films
let the audience never forget , even a missile strike ca n't kill james bond , james bond is immortal and will always be , so do n't give up hope , critics will say this is the end and they finally killed a seemingly immortal james bond , but remember , no he 's not seemingly immortal he is immortal and never give up the immortal james bond cannot be killed
excellent ! ! ! ! no time to die was absolutely brilliant fantastic way to end the craig era
quirky and a brilliant end to dc 's legacy i would n't listen to the negative nora 's brilliant script , fun and light hearted and extremely emotional in other parts i almost waited for phoebe waller bridge to come out in some scenes and stare at the camera very good writing and daniel craig did n't dissapoint absolutely loved it
pefecto ! the movie was a pleasure to watch and a great sendoff to daniel craig would recommend to watch sll the installments for who has not watched any bond movies perfect endng for craig 's 007 !
worth to watch it 's a perfect ending to a daniel craig 's james bond story
wrong actress for bond replacement ana de lamas made a better agent than lashana lynch lynch pretty much sleepwalks through her part while lamas gives a dynamic performance
barnstorming bold bond finale for craig it was scary , it was funny , it has heart in mouth moments , great pathos and an irresistible connection with the past i was hooked from the first frame it is a beautiful companion piece to my favourite classic bond film ohmss the villain played my rami malek was perfectly pitched as both evil and fragile fantastic sets , stunning scenery and locations and superb believable stunts i cannot wait to see it again
honestly just ignore the horrible reviews and go see it i was extremely skeptical to go see this movie especially seeing some bad reviews and thinking this movie would be about serving a political woke message with the new 007 it 's hard to go into much detail without spoiling the movie it was extremely tense in a great way and i did n't want to miss a second so i avoided going to use the restroom the way they handled the new 007 really was impressive daniel craig delivered his best performance as james bond please go see this film , without expectations and form your own opinion thank me later
best bond movie by far such a masterpiece graig took this role to another level cinematography , plot , music , amazing picture a must watch
classical action and love story bond fees like 500 crore unique story this is last part of spector organization i m from india , my name is er madhur jain i was watched this movie on sangam cineplex bhopal madhya pradesh , tom cruise and daniel craig my favourite
no time to blink from the opening to the closing , gripping story which is cleverly interlinked cast superb , dc puts his heart and soul into his final outing love it
the best one ! great movie ! ! ! very emotional , like it is the end of the world we knew for so many years one era is over 60 beautiful years with james bond ! i 'd recommend this film to any james bond fan and no fan alike very , very quality film with proper emotion , a good dose of seriousness , beautiful camera , wonderful soundtrack and professional acting 10 10 , it left me in tears
the swan song we needed long live craig 's bond best villains since skyfall , not quite on bardems level , but devilishly close it 's surprisingly funny , which i did not expect , given the more serious nature craig 's series has had it 's also surprisingly emotional , which is fitting given the circumstances i wo n't talk about plot because it 's pointless you 're seeing it anyway , let 's be honest my personal favourite of the series 10 10
a fascinating and breathtaking killing sensation this film is sufficient to see me killing people who try to kill me all night in the dream at some stage there were even killing dreams within dreams bearing a remarkable resemblance to the dream layer in inception \( 2010 \) well done another epic action and thriller movie !
one of the best bond movie ever well scripted and directed it 's painfull to see daniel craig last time as a bond new agents were classy and finally bond got the family loved the movie
no time to die no time to die was really awesome movie everyone should go and see it while it is still in theaters
remarkable end of daniel craig era ! beautiful movie ! this is a perfect end to the daniel craig sequence the rhythm of the movie is unique and the most relevant classic features of james bond are all in the movie the car chases featuring some classics like the db5 and the range rover defender models are top of the game and you will find yourself glued to the chair watching daniel craig presents a new interpretation of a more mature bond a man finally in peace with himself and staying truthful to the highest expectations one could have about james bond until the very last scene , daniel is absolutely superb rami malek delivers a unique villain \( lyutsifer safin \) , l a seydoux is also awesome as madeleine and all the other usual suspects deliver what you expect \( m , q , moneypenny \) now ana de armas brings a unique sense of humor and sharp acting and the same can be said about lashana lynch as nini breathtaking landscapes around the world involved by hans zimmer soundtrack are pearl that make this a top bond movie final note the billie eilish song is incredible and very in line with the mood of the entire movie superb
how can you not like this \? i loved this movie if only because of the ending what 's interesting is that most of the action in the trailer only occurs in the first 21 minutes ! even more amazing is that the title does n't come up until 21 minutes in ! i think that 's the longest i 've ever seen in a movie we get another great animated intro that rivals skyfall ! we need guns in the shape of double helixes , obviously foreshadowing the film this is the longest james bond movie ever made , but it does n't waste its time at all ! so the plot is basically that bond has retired and is with his wife when they 're attacked on vacation if there was anything that was the status quo with james bond , it 's that he could never get a wife , much less a family six years later , he finds out about a new organization that 's targeting spectre and decides to go back into the business , even though his 007 codename has been assigned to a woman ! he meets up with his wife again who has a kid who claims it is n't his the enemy is working on nanobot technology , that is , a microscopic weapon that can kill targets bond becomes infected to the point where he ca n't touch his wife or yeah , it 's his daughter , so he actually dies ! yes , after 25 years of movies \( and having seen every one of them \) james bond has finally been killed ! i can not believe that they took this truly innovative and bold move to forever change the status quo of such a popular long running series apart from great locations , great characterizations and unique action , , this masterpiece is spun together by a attempt to truly create a finale for the series okay , it 's only for daniel craig 's james bond as the credits tell us that james bond will return , but fantastic nonetheless !
what a finale i'm in my forties and have been watching bond movies with my dad since i can remember if you are a fan , you will be amazed themes from her majesty 's secret service and others , connections with the past that unveils unexplained aspects of bond 's personal aspects of his life , etc do not get any spoiler before watching this beautiful finale this actor has never been my favourite bond but he really made a great exit so much better than his previous 4 appearances bravo !
finally casino royale gets the sequel it deserves ! wow just wow 167 minutes of exactly what i wanted and i think what we needed bond to be daniel craig has been without a doubt the best bond he came in hard with casino royale \( which i think to this day , remains the jewel in 007 's crown \) and carried the poor scripts executions that were quantum of solace , skyfall spectre the fact that daniel craig could make these films stand out is testament to his portrayal of james bond in the last 15 years , we 've frustratingly had some of the best ever scenes in bond films but we 've had some really poorly finished articles whether it be the ridiculous quantum of solace \( pointless \) , hash mash of skyfall \( epic scenes ruined by rock concert helicopters \) or the full of promise spectre \( but lacking like the latter brosnan outings \) daniel craig has held our interest so it is entirely fitting that he is given the best of swan songs ram packed with everything that bond should be , it delves into his flaws , his weakness like casino royale does it opens up the side we wanted to see for all these years yet it somehow retains the authenticity the franchise has kept for all these years the fact that the last 5 films have interlinked with its characters set in the background has been wonderful full of subtle nods and easter eggs to the bond films over the years , it opens up for subtle acceptance and progress for those of a certain age bracket or prejudice , they will see parts of this film and panic that their heterosexual , white hero will be no more rest assured bond will always be bond and this film will not disappoint
